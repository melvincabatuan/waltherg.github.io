          <p>Software for the parameter-free analysis of chemical reaction
          networks. This user-friendly software allows you to analyze if
          a reaction network of interest has the capability to show
          multistability, pattern formation, or oscillations.
          GraTeLPy is easy to use, entirely free, and can be deployed to
          compute clusters -- making the analysis of large reaction networks
          feasible.</p>

        <p class="lead">With GraTeLPy you can rapidly decide if your chemical
    reaction network has the potential to show multistability, patterns, or
    oscillations.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <p>GraTeLPy is a new software package that determines if your
            chemical reaction network (CRN) meets necessary conditions for
            multistability, pattern formation, or oscillations.
            This method represents your CRN as a bipartite directed graph and
            determines if this graph contains certain elements, "critical
            fragments", that are necessary for the aforementioned phenomena --
            GraTeLPy can tell you with certainty when your CRN does not have
            the potential to display these phenomena.
            If your CRN does have this potential, GraTeLPy can guide estimation
            of parameter values so that these phenomena are observed.</p>

        <p class="lead">At present, GraTeLPy is applicable to all chemical
        reaction networks with mass-action kinetics. Read on for an overview
        of published analyses.</p>

          <h3>Photosynthesis & Photorespiration</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjc-2013-0315">In their article</a>,
          Ruhul Amin and Marc Roussel used GraTeLPy to show that a
          delay-free version of their model of photsynthesis and
          photorespiration does not have the potential for oscillations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h3>Reversible Substrate Inhibition</h3>
          <p>A generic model for reversible substrate inhibition that was
          analyzed by Mincheva and Roussel is an example where parameter
          values necessary for multistability were could be estimated based
          on the output generated by GraTeLPy.
          GraTeLPy accepts chemical reaction networks in a plain-text
          format that is close to how we write these mechanisms by hand.</p>
          <div class="row">
          <div class="highlight col-lg-6 col-md-6">
            <p>The input format expected by GraTeLPy:</p>
            <pre>
              <code class="bash">
                [A1] -> ; k1
                -> [A1]; k2
                [A1] + [A2] -> [A3] ; k3
                [A3] -> [A2] ; k4
                [A1] + [A3] -> [A4] ; k5
                [A4] -> [A1] + [A3] ; k6
              </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
            Here, A1 is a substrate, A2 is an enzyme, and both A3 and A4
            are substrate-enzyme complexes.
            </p>
            <p>
            GraTeLPy creates automatically the bipartite directed graph
            from this input file, enumerates all fragments and tests for
            criticality - with no further user input required.
            </p>
            <p>
            For this example, GraTeLPy identifies correctly the one 
            critical fragment of order 3 that this reaction network contains.
            Our software further lists all subgraphs that make up this
            critical fragment allowing us to identify the chemical
            reactions that are critical for phenomena such as multistability.
            </p>
            <p>
            Knowing all critical fragments of a mechanism, allows us to
            write down a polynomial which will then guide estimation of
            parameter values that will allow us to observe multistability,
            pattern formation, or oscillations.
            Mincheva and Roussel demonstrate this methodology for this
            example in their publication, and we are working to include
            this approach in GraTeLPy.
            </p>

            <h3>Double-Layer MAPK Mechanism</h3>
            <p>Biochemical mechanisms often encompass many chemical species
              and reactions, making the analysis of large chemical
              reaction networks highly desirable.
              GraTeLPy can be deployed on both shared-memory multiprocessor
              computers and distributed-memory setups (clusters).
              Distribution across compute clusters is optimized to
              minimize communication between computers and maximize work done
              by each computer individually - thus the running time of
              GraTeLPy on clusters scales very well with the number of
              compute nodes used.
            </p>
            <p>A 
              <a href="https://github.com/gratelpy/gratelpy-supplementary-information/blob/master/double_layer_mapk_system/double_layer_mapk_mechanism.txt">double-layer MAPK mechanism</a> 
              that we discuss in our
              forthcoming software article has 12 chemical species and
              18 reactions. 
              To the best of our knowledge, this is the biggest 
              reaction network analyzed with the
              graph-theoretic framework underlying GraTeLPy.
              This analysis took GraTeLPy just several hours when we deployed
              computations to a mid-sized cluster of about 300 nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our forthcoming software article discusses this network in
              more detail and our
              <a href="https://github.com/gratelpy/gratelpy-supplementary-information">data repository</a>
              provides detailed results of our analysis for this and other
              mechanisms.
