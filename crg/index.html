          <h2>What is GraTeLPy?</h2>
          <p>GraTeLPy falls into a class of software packages that
          analyze stability properties of chemical reaction networks
          based on a graph representation of their reactions.
          At present, GraTeLPy can tell you with certainty when
          your network cannot show multistability, pattern formation,
          or oscillations - without specifying any parameter values.
          This eliminates networks that do not possess desirable
          stability properties, greatly <strong>simplifying and accelerating
          model discrimination</strong>.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>Applications</h2>
          <p>GraTeLPy can <strong>test all chemical reaction 
          networks</strong> independent
          of their field of application.
          At present, GraTeLPy assumes mass action kinetics for all
          reactions - however we are working to include other rate laws.
          GraTeLPy can be <strong>deployed to clusters and the cloud</strong>,
          thus greatly increasing the size of networks that can be
          analyzed.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>We actively improve and expand GraTeLPy and are working
          to offer exciting capabilities such as <strong>estimating parameter
          values</strong>
          so that your network shows desired stability properties.
          Other future expansions include support for networks with delay
          and rate laws different from mass action kinetics.
          GraTeLPy is based on a <strong>solid theoretical framework</strong> 
          and rooted
          in an environment of similar frameworks and software packages.

        <p class="lead">With GraTeLPy you can rapidly decide if your chemical
          reaction network has the potential to show multistability, 
          patterns, or oscillations.</p>

        <p>GraTeLPy is a new software package that determines if your
          chemical reaction network (CRN) meets necessary conditions for
          multistability, pattern formation, or oscillations.
          This method represents your CRN as a bipartite directed graph and
          determines if this graph contains certain elements, "critical
          fragments", that are necessary for the aforementioned phenomena --
          GraTeLPy can tell you with certainty when your CRN does not have
          the potential to display these phenomena.
          If your CRN does have this potential, GraTeLPy can guide estimation
          of parameter values so that these phenomena are observed.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjc-2013-0315">In their article</a>,
          Ruhul Amin and Marc Roussel used GraTeLPy to show that a
          delay-free version of their model of photsynthesis and
          photorespiration does not have the potential for oscillations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h3>Reversible Substrate Inhibition</h3>
        <p>A generic model for reversible substrate inhibition that was
          analyzed by Mincheva and Roussel is an example where parameter
          values necessary for multistability were could be estimated based
          on the output generated by GraTeLPy.
          GraTeLPy accepts chemical reaction networks in a plain-text
          format that is close to how we write these mechanisms by hand.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
          <p>The input format expected by GraTeLPy:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="bash">
              [A1] -> ; k1
              -> [A1]; k2
              [A1] + [A2] -> [A3] ; k3
              [A3] -> [A2] ; k4
              [A1] + [A3] -> [A4] ; k5
              [A4] -> [A1] + [A3] ; k6
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here, A1 is a substrate, A2 is an enzyme, and both A3 and A4
            are substrate-enzyme complexes.
          </p>
          <p>
            GraTeLPy creates automatically the bipartite directed graph
            from this input file, enumerates all fragments and tests for
            criticality - with no further user input required.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this example, GraTeLPy identifies correctly the one 
            critical fragment of order 3 that this reaction network contains.
            Our software further lists all subgraphs that make up this
            critical fragment allowing us to identify the chemical
            reactions that are critical for phenomena such as multistability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing all critical fragments of a mechanism, allows us to
            write down a polynomial which will then guide estimation of
            parameter values that will allow us to observe multistability,
            pattern formation, or oscillations.
            Mincheva and Roussel demonstrate this methodology for this
            example in their publication, and we are working to include
            this approach in GraTeLPy.
          </p>

        <h3>Double-Layer MAPK Mechanism</h3>
        <p>Biochemical mechanisms often encompass many chemical species
          and reactions, making the analysis of large chemical
          reaction networks highly desirable.
          GraTeLPy can be deployed on both shared-memory multiprocessor
          computers and distributed-memory setups (clusters).
          Distribution across compute clusters is optimized to
          minimize communication between computers and maximize work done
          by each computer individually - thus the running time of
          GraTeLPy on clusters scales very well with the number of
          compute nodes used.
        </p>
        <p>A

          that we discuss in our
          <a href="#walther2013">forthcoming software article</a>
          has 12 chemical species and
          18 reactions. 
          To the best of our knowledge, this is the biggest 
          reaction network analyzed with the
          graph-theoretic framework underlying GraTeLPy.
          This analysis took GraTeLPy just several hours when we deployed
          computations to a mid-sized cluster of about 300 nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <a href="#walther2013">forthcoming software article</a>
          discusses this network in
          more detail and our
          <a href="https://github.com/gratelpy/gratelpy-supplementary-information">data repository</a>
          provides detailed results of our analysis for this and other
          mechanisms.

        <p class="lead">GraTeLPy is based on a solid theoretical framework
          and complements existing software tools.</p>
        
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>Our implementation is described in detail in our
          <a href="#walther2013">forthcoming software article</a>
          and we would be delighted to provide details
          <a href="#contact">upon request</a>.

          <h3>Theoretical Background</h3>
        <p>At present, GraTeLPy is mostly based on theory developed by
          <a href="#ivaonva1979">Ivanova</a> 
          which was translated and further developed by
          <a href="#mincheva2007">Mincheva and Roussel</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Extensions to GraTeLPy</h3>
        <p>
          We are working presently to automate parameter value estimation
          based on the output generated by GraTeLPy.
          Our goal here is to estimate parameter values for which
          phenomena of interest, such as multistability, pattern formation,
          and oscillations can be observed.
          This works theoretically and has been shown by
          <a href="#mincheva2007">Mincheva and Roussel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          GraTeLPy can further be expanded to chemical reactions with
          non-mass-action kinetics.
          The theoretical framework for this has been described by
          <a href="#mincheva2008">Mincheva and Craciun</a>
          and involves a representation of the chemical reaction network
          as a directed multigraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph-theoretic framework that GraTeLPy is based on has
          also been extended to reaction networks with delay by
          <a href="#mincheva2007a">Mincheva and Roussel</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Software Packages</h3>
        <p>
          To the best of our knowledge, GraTeLPy is the first implementation
          of the critical fragments theory put forward by
          <a href="#mincheva2007">Mincheva and Roussel</a>.
          Contrary to some existing software packages that are similar
          to GraTeLPy, our software is both free and open
          (our users are free to download and modify our source code),
          and is intended for large networks through deployment to
          clusters.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best known network analysis software packages is
          the
          <a href="http://www.crnt.osu.edu/crntwin">
            Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox
          </a>
          developed by
          <a href="#feinberg1987">Feinberg et al</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A MATLAB toolbox called
          <a href="http://people.sissa.it/~altafini/papers/SoAl09/">
            ERNEST
          </a>
          is available and has been described in a publication by
          <a href="#soranzo2009">Soranzo and Altafani</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A web service,
          <a href="http://reaction-networks.net/control/">
            CoNtRol
          </a>,
          implements analysis based on a type of directed multigraph,
          DSR graph, that has been described by
          <a href="#banaji2009">Banaji and Craciun</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another MATLAB package,
          <a href="http://math.wvu.edu/~cpantea/misc.html">
            BioNetX
          </a>,
          is available and has been described by
          <a href="#pantea2010">Pantea and Craciun</a>
          as well as
          <a href="#pantea2012">Pantea, Koeppl, and Craciun</a>.
          However, this package now seems superseded by the
          aforementioned CoNtRol web service.

        <p class="lead">GraTeLPy is based on Python and NetworkX
          making it simple to install on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>

        <p>Installation on Linux and Mac is straightforward
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/gratelpy/gratelpy#installation">
            described here</a>.
          Unfortunately, installation on Windows is not yet as easy and
          we know of users who have had difficulties.
          However, we are working on a solution and will offer
          a simple installation process for Windows soon.</p>
