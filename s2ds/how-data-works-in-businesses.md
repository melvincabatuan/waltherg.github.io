# How Data Works in Businesses

[Mohamed Zaki](http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/mehyz2/) of the
Cambridge Service Alliance spoke to us about monetization of data in
the business world.
These notes are based on his talk.

## Introduction

- "Data is the new oil"
    * Attributed to [Clive Humby](http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/p2000/People/Faculty/Visiting-Professors/Clive-nbspHumby-nbsp)
    * Related company: [dunnhumby.com](http://www.dunnhumby.com/)
- Question is how to monetize data / capture value of data
- Two distinct venues where data and big data can have an impact:
    * Optimization of existing services
    * Data-driven business models

## Optimization of Existing Services

### Sectors

- Education:
    * Competency-based learning
    * Personalized learning adapted to learning style
    * Student as a customer!
- Asset heavy industry:
    * Sensors to monitor machinery to predict and warn of failure early
- Defense:
    * Availability / outcome-based contracts:
      Contracted to keep machinery / planes available for an amount of
      time
    * Sensors are used to collect data and monitor and predict availability
- Service offerings:
    * Monetization  through service contracts

### Barriers to Using Data

- Complex service networks (CSNs) describe intricate customer structures

#### Internal barriers (cultural, people issues):

#### Advice

- Political work likely needs to happen first
- You will likely need support of top management:
    * You need someone at the top that shares and supports your
      data-driven vision, that cares about the strategy, your values,
      and that understands revenue potential
- Interpret your data-driven approach as a strategy:
    * 'Me too': We want to catch up with competitors when it comes to
      data-driven decisions / defensive strategy
    * Innovation: We want to innovate in the sphere of data-driven decisions
    * Branding of your data-driven approach is important when communicating
      it within your company
- Incentivize close collaborative work between departments and yourself
    * Important due to siloed data
- Work collaboratively
    * Collect feedback about the usefulness of your models
    * Iterate over modelling execution and feedback
- Share best practices across your company
- Generally, data scientists cannot work by themselves,
  need a cross functional team, and both soft and political skills to
  convince others of the value of their data-driven approaches

#### Issues

- Data accessibility: Possible legislative barriers to data transmission
    * Saudi Arabia disallow transmission via satellites
- Data governance, quality, and integration
- Data ownership and sharing
    * E.g. data collected by sensors is not usually regarded as an asset
      when selling machinery (but ownership becomes a problem later)
- Sensitive data: Oftentimes this cannot be shared and the expert working
  on the data needs to be brought into company to work there directly
- Data is often locked up in silos: Marketing, sales etc. all have their
  own data
- Performance measurement: Most CSNs stop as soon as their customer is
  happy without pursuing optimization, performance evaluation

### External Issues

- You need to demonstrate what value your data-driven approach adds to
  everyone in the network

## Data-Driven Business Model (DDBM)

- Data source is important
- Key activity of business: aggregation, modeling, prediction, etc.
- Offering of the business: data and knowledge
- Target customers: B2B, B2C
- Revenue model:
    * asset sale / rent / lease (asset is data and/or knowledge)
    * advertise
