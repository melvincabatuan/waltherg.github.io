# Science 2 Data Science

Science 2 Data Science (S2DS) is an industry-sponsored course with the aim
of leading graduates with a quantitative background into the industry of
data analytics and
[data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science).

The S2DS program has at least two components:
During the first six days of the program we hear about technologies
and methodologies that are deemed essential for practicing data science,
and most of the remaining time we work in small teams on specific projects
with the industry partners of the program.

On the following pages I try and summarize what I learned at this course
with the intention of keeping a legible record of the topics we hear about
and giving me the opportunity to expand upon certain aspects by linking
to relevant information elsewhere.

You can read more about the course at [s2ds.org](http://www.s2ds.org/) or
