# How This Page Was Made

I am in the process of building my personal website that I intend to use
mostly as a blog.
I chose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) in combination with
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), which is a true and tested solution
for personal and scientific blogs by now.
There are countless fantastic tutorials that cover setting up a blog
with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, for instance
[Cecil Woebker](http://cwoebker.com/posts/jekyll-blogging)'s post.

Before building this website, I knew I would want my blog to have
the following technical features:

* Rendering of mathematical equations written in <code>\latex</code>
* a visual tagging system to mark certain posts as work-in-progress
  while I still work on them, and
* continuous row labels for all text and code rows in each blog post.
