# PLOS Biology-Inspired PLOS Biology Articles

This past week I had my first encounter with the concept of [graph
databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)
which lend themselves perfectly to modeling and capturing linked data.

I started reading the free and brilliant book [Graph
Databases](http://www.graphdatabases.com/) by Robinson, Webber, and Eifrem and
began playing around with [Python bulbs](http://bulbflow.com/) by James
Thornton.

I further took the data set of 1754 PLOS Biology articles that I have examined
on this blog multiple times and created a
[Rexster](https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki)-based graph database from
them.
Apart from the obvious authors, DOIs, and titles I also extracted references to
other PLOS Biology articles.

In this blog post I will examine these links between PLOS Biology articles.

## The Graph Database

Let us first take a look at my database to get an idea of what this looks like.

    %matplotlib inline
    from matplotlib import pyplot


    from bulbs.rexster import Graph, Config, REXSTER_URI


    REXSTER_URI = 'http://localhost:8182/graphs/plos'
    config = Config(REXSTER_URI)


    g = Graph(config)

The label `g` now holds a reference to our graph database.

Python bulbs allows us to define classes for our data model which is something I
did when creating this graph database in the first place.

## Our Graph Model

These are the node (vertex) types and edge (relationship) types I defined:


    # Bulbs Models
    from bulbs.model import Node, Relationship
    from bulbs.property import String, Integer, DateTime, List
    
    class Author(Node):
        element_type = 'author'
        name = String(nullable=False)
        
    class Article(Node):
        element_type = 'article'
        title = String(nullable=False)
        published = DateTime()
        doi = String()
        
    class Authorship(Relationship):
        label = 'authored'
    
    class Citation(Relationship):
        label = 'cites'
        reference_count = Integer(nullable=False)
        tag = String()

This is a very basic model of PLOS Biology articles that captures nothing more
than authorship (edges between authors and articles) and
citations (edges between articles).

Some of these concepts can and should probably be decorated further: for
instance `Authorship` edges could include author contributions (as provided at
the bottom of most PLOS Biology articles).


    g.add_proxy('authors', Author)
    g.add_proxy('articles', Article)
    g.add_proxy('authored', Authorship)
    g.add_proxy('cites', Citation)


## Querying the Database

Usually we would use Rexster/Bulbs-builtin functions that rely on some internal
index but since that index seems to be broken for me right now
I will simply collect all nodes and edges by hand and create Python dictionaries
as indeces.

This is okay here to do since our database is very small but would likely be
prohibitive for anything marginally bigger.


    nodes = g.V
    edges = g.E


    authors = {n.name: n for n in nodes if n.element_type == 'author'}

Here are ten authors in our database:

    authors.keys()[:10]

    [u'Shuguang Zhang',
     u'Ernst Hafen',
     u'Maren Brockmeyer',
     u'Bruno Eschli',
     u'David B. Gurevich',
     u'Michael Lynch',
     u'Alejandro Valbuena',
     u'Claudia Rutte',
     u'Matthew M Wyatt',
     u'Brianna B. Williams']



    articles = {n.doi: n for n in nodes if n.element_type == 'article'}

And here are the DOI's of ten articles in our database:

    articles.keys()[:10]

    [u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040216',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040215',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040210',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040368',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040369',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040362',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040363',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040360',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0020275',
     u'10.1371/journal.pbio.0040366']



Let us now do a brief sanity check and count the number of PLOS Biology articles
in our data set (this should equal 1754).


    len(articles.keys())

    1754


## Examining One Article

Let us now pick an article at random and see how this article is connected to
the remainder of the graph.


    article = articles['10.1371/journal.pbio.1000584']

This is the title of `article`:


    article.title

    u'Clusters of Temporal Discordances Reveal Distinct Embryonic Patterning Mechanisms in Drosophila and Anopheles'



These are the edges pointing to this article:


    list(article.inE())

    [<Authorship: http://localhost:8182/graphs/plos/edges/21895>,
     <Authorship: http://localhost:8182/graphs/plos/edges/21893>,
     <Authorship: http://localhost:8182/graphs/plos/edges/21891>]



There are three `Authorship` edges that point to this specific article.

To get the node at the *base* of a directed edge we can either query
`article.inE().inV()` (i.e. the *in-node* of this edge)
or simply ask for the *in-node* of the `article` node straight away - this
should be equivalent!


    for author in article.inV():
        print author.name

    Yury Goltsev
    Michael Levine
    Dmitri Papatsenko


A quick check online confirms that these are indeed the authors of `article`.

As I mentioned above, I also collected all references to other PLOS Biology
articles in my data set and modeled those as `Citation` relationships (edges)
between articles.

The `article` we are currently looking at has one such out-edge to another PLOS
Biology article:


    list(article.outE())

    [<Citation: http://localhost:8182/graphs/plos/edges/29290>]

And these are the title, authors, and DOI of the article cited by `article`:

    for citation in article.outV():
        print citation.title
        print [n.name for n in citation.inV() if n.element_type == 'author']
        print citation.doi

    The Cell Cycleâ€“Regulated Genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe
    [u'Saumyadipta Pyne', u'Janet Leatherwood', u'Anna Oliva', u'Bruce Futcher', u'Adam Rosebrock', u'Steve Skiena', u'Francisco Ferrezuelo', u'Haiying Chen']
    10.1371/journal.pbio.0030225


As you can see above, querying our database for the authors of the PLOS Biology
article that our current article (`article`) cites is simple.

## Number of PLOS Biology Articles That Cite Other PLOS Biology Articles

How many PLOS Biology articles in our data set of 1754 articles cite other PLOS
Biology articles?

(caveat: this only represents those citations that I detected when parsing my
set of articles)


    sum(1 for n in nodes if n.element_type == 'article' and n.outV() > 0)

    526



I did not only extract citation edges between PLOS Biology articles but also
counted how often such a citation occurs in the body of the article.

For our `article` and its one cited PLOS Biology article I counted:


    for citation in article.outE():
        print citation.reference_count

    2


Just to verify this, look up `article` online (DOI =
10.1371/journal.pbio.0030225) and look for reference *[4]* which corresponds to
this one cited PLOS Biology article.

## Distribution of PLOS Biology-Internal References

### Allowing Self-Citation

Let us now take a look at the observed distribution of how often cited PLOS
Biology articles are referenced in the main text of the citing PLOS Biology
article.


    citation_counts = []
    for doi in articles.keys():
        if articles[doi].outE():
            for e in articles[doi].outE():
                if e.label == 'cites':
                    citation_counts.append(e.reference_count)


    pyplot.hist(citation_counts, bins=range(20))
    pyplot.xlabel('number of times cited')
    pyplot.ylabel('count')

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x9a293d0>

![png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/129945779/georgio/2014-03-22-PLOS_Biology-Inspired_PLOS_Biology_files/2014-03-22-PLOS_Biology-Inspired_PLOS_Biology_39_1.png)


This histogram has a surprisingly long tail. Let us take a look at some of the
bigger values to see if these make sense.


    def article_pp(article):
        authors = unicode(', '.join([n.name for n in article.inV() if n.element_type == 'author']))
        s = ('Title: %s\n'
            'Authors: %s\n'
            'DOI: %s' % (article.title, authors, article.doi))
        
        return s


    for edge in edges:
        if edge.label == 'cites':
            if edge.reference_count >= 21:
                print('Citer:')
                print(article_pp(edge.outV()))
                print('')
                print('Citee')
                print(article_pp(edge.inV()))
                print('')
                print('Citer cites citee %d times.' % edge.reference_count)
                print('-----------------------------------------------------')

**Citer**:

**Title**: A Feedback Loop between Dynamin and Actin Recruitment during Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis

**Authors**: Marko Lampe, Christien J. Merrifield, Marcus J. Taylor

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001302
    
**Citee**:

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000604
    
**Citer cites citee 21 times.**

**Citer**:

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050081
    
**Citee**:

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020342
    
**Citer cites citee 21 times.**

---

Checking these by hand we verify that our counts are correct.

I think it is sensible to postulate that the more often one article cites
another one, the more heavily the work presented in the *citer* was influenced
by the *citee*.

There is certainly some cut-off at which *importance* stops increasing - my
point is simply that citing another article multiple times in your manuscript
probably means that you are basing your work at least partially on the article
you cite.

### Disallowing Self-Citation

For both pairs above we can see that at least one author is shared between citer and citee.

One question I am interested in is: How inspiring is the work of one group of authors for a
completely different group of authors?

In my opinion, if one group of authors inspires a completely different group of
authors to carry out scientific work (be it to follow up, refute, or whatever)
then that defines *knowledge transfer* and a point at which scientific knowledge
really becomes worth the time and resources it cost to produce this knowledge in
the first place.

(I am certain this statement can be refined further but roughly speaking this is
what I think)

Let us redo the above histogram but exclude all pairs of citers and citees that share one or more authors.

(one more bracketed caveat: When constructing my database I assumed that every
author name occurs exactly once and is therefore unique - this is a heuristic
that breaks easily)


    def are_different_authors(article_1, article_2):
        authors_1 = []
        authors_2 = []
        
        for n in article_1.inV():
            if n.element_type == 'author':
                authors_1.append(n.name)
        for n in article_2.inV():
            if n.element_type == 'author':
                authors_2.append(n.name)
                
        authors_1 = set(authors_1)
        authors_2 = set(authors_2)
        
        return len(authors_1.intersection(authors_2)) == 0



    citation_counts = []
    
    for edge in edges:
        if edge.label == 'cites':
            if are_different_authors(edge.inV(), edge.outV()):
                citation_counts.append(edge.reference_count)


    pyplot.hist(citation_counts, bins=range(20))
    pyplot.xlabel('number of times cited')
    pyplot.ylabel('count')

    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xaa25310>

![png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/129945779/georgio/2014-03-22-PLOS_Biology-Inspired_PLOS_Biology_files/2014-03-22-PLOS_Biology-Inspired_PLOS_Biology_51_1.png)


This histogram does not look very different from the one above.

Let us take a look at data points in the tail:


    for edge in edges:
        if edge.label == 'cites':
            if edge.reference_count >= 16 and are_different_authors(edge.inV(), edge.outV()):
                print('Citer:')
                print(article_pp(edge.outV()))
                print('')
                print('Citee')
                print(article_pp(edge.inV()))
                print('')
                print('Citer cites citee %d times.' % edge.reference_count)
                print('-----------------------------------------------------')

**Citer**:

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000068
    
**Citer cites citee 17 times.**

**DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001226
    
**Citer cites citee 16 times.**

-----------------------------------------------------

As we can see the two article pairs in the tail of this updated distribution are
linked with lower reference counts than what we observed before filtering for
author disjointedness.

## The Most Inspiring PLOS Biology Articles (PLOS Biology-Internally)

Now, how inspiring are PLOS Biology authors for other (different) PLOS Biology
authors?

To answer this question, I would like to propose a measure that I have called
**Inspiration Factor** in my own head for some time now and one variant of the
model I have had in mind is this:

Inspiration is an increasing function of the number of authors (unrelated to
you) that you inspired to carry out scientific work.

Since I do not want to count citations that are mentioned only once in the main
text of an article, I will impose a threshold of at least *three references*.

I should refine the way I parse articles to account for the context that
citations are referenced in.

Anyways, let us take a look at those PLOS Biology articles that have inspired at
least three other PLOS Biology articles.


    inspirators = []
    
    for article in articles.values():
        in_nodes = []
        if article.inE():
            for edge in article.inE():
                if edge.label == 'cites':
                    if are_different_authors(edge.inV(), edge.outV()) and edge.reference_count >= 3:
                        in_nodes.append([edge.outV(), edge.reference_count])
                        
        if len(in_nodes) >= 3:
            inspirators.append([article, in_nodes])


And this is the number of PLOS Biology articles in my data set that have been referenced by three or more PLOS Biology articles at least three times (i.e. these are our **inspirators**):

    len(inspirators)

    2

And here our our inspirators in more detail:

    for inspirator in inspirators:
        print('Inspirator')
        print article_pp(inspirator[0])
        print('')
        for el in inspirator[1]:
            print('Inspired Article')
            print article_pp(el[0])
            print('Cites inspirator %d times.' % el[1])
            print('')
        print('--------------------------------------')
        print('')

**Edit**: Upon closer inspection I realize that my method of distinguishing authors, implemented in `are_different_authors`, is too simplistic to properly distinguish authors in my data set.
You will find that the names of some authors are spelled with and without abbreviation periods such as *Alexander D Johnson* versus *Alexander D. Johnson*.
Amending `are_different_authors` to catch these spelling variations shows that both inspirators listed below are not inspirators as defined by my arbitrary categories.
Rather than updating `are_different_authors` with some ad-hoc fix I will think about this issue more coherently and leave the misclassified articles below to show that author disambiguation is not easy.

## Outlook: Inspiration Chains

And that is it for now.

I will expand my data set to include more articles and think about how to enrich
the data I extract from these articles.

One question that I am very intrigued to tackle soon is: How long of a chain of
scientific discovery do you trigger?

I imagine that an article that lies at the beginning of a long chain of articles
that inspired one another would have some significance.
