  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I am a biochemist and computational biologist by training and a fledgling
    data analyst and web developer by personal interest and passion.

    I am enthused by predictive analytics and data-driven decision making
    as well as the entrepreneurial opportunities they create and the
    technologies that lie at their heart.
  </p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    I am in the process of completing a research PhD in computational biology
    and am looking for new challenges starting in September / October 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
    My objective is to join or start an enticing and vibrant work
    environment that offers technical challenges in machine learning,
    data mining, and predictive analytics.
  </p>
  <hr/>

  <h2>Technical Expertise and Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I am proficient in both Python and C and know my way around MATLAB /
    Octave and Mathematica.

    I am aspiring to tackle JavaScript more thoroughly and to brush up on
    my C++.

    I work on Linux systems most of my time but am comfortable switching
    to other platforms for development when necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have succeeded in computer science courses on object-oriented
    programming, data structures, algorithms, and software architecture
    hence feel comfortable with basic computer science
    at a conceptual level.
    I am therefore comfortable switching programming languages while
    retaining deeper understanding of important concepts.
  </p>

  <h3>Numerical Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    I have received formal training in numerical analysis, enjoy
    refreshing my knowledge of numerical methods, and blog about these
    methods when I can at
    <a href="http://georg.io/na">http://georg.io/na</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
  <p>
    I am comfortable with basic data structures and algorithms and
    am <a href="https://github.com/waltherg/data-structures-algorithms">
    in the process</a> of brushing up on these.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Machine Learning and Statistics</h3>
  <p>
    I have received formal training in computational statistics and
    introductory probability theory.
  </p>

  <h3>Natural Language Processing and Text Mining</h3>
  <p>
    Driven by my own interest in these areas, I apply regularly
    techniques from these fields to scientific publications and blog
    about my discoveries at
    <a href="http://georg.io/nlp">http://georg.io/nlp</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Development</h3>
  <p>
    Excited by the response to one of my blog posts on
    <a href="http://georg.io/2014/01/PLoS_Biology_Author_Action/">summarizing PLOS Biology articles</a>
    I started development of a web application at
    <a href="http://tldrmed.com/">TLDRMed.com</a> that does just that.
  </p>

  <h3>High Performance Computing</h3>
  <p>
    I have great interest in low-level code optimization and parallel computing.
    I completed recently an online course titled "Applications of Parallel Computers" (facilitated by XSEDE) that covered a range of topics such as single machine optimization (cache optimization and vectorization), shared-memory parallelism, and distributed-memory parallelism.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Writing</h3>
  <p>
    I enjoy writing about technical topics and discoveries on my personal
    blog at <a href="http://georg.io">http://georg.io</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am the corresponding author on a
    <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/8/22">peer-reviewed article
      </a>
    on our Python package that implements a graph-theoretic method for
    the analysis of stability and bifurcation properties of dynamical
    systems.
    I have further co-authored a
    <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11538-012-9766-5">
      peer-reviewed article</a>
    on our computational study of stochastic effects on cell polarization.
