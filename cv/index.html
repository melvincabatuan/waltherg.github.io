  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    I am a biochemist &amp; computational biologist by training and a
    data analyst &amp; web developer by personal interest and passion.

    I am enthused by predictive analytics and data-driven decision making
    as well as the entrepreneurial opportunities they create and the
    technologies that lie at their heart.
  </p>

  <!-- <h3>Objective</h3> -->
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   I am in the process of completing a research PhD in computational biology -->
  <!--   and am looking for new challenges starting in September / October 2014. -->
  <!-- </p> -->
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   My objective is to join an enticing and vibrant work -->
  <!--   environment that offers technical challenges in machine learning, -->
  <!--   data mining, and predictive analytics. -->
  <!-- </p> -->

  <h3>Technical Expertise, Interests, and Projects</h3>
  <p>
    I am proficient in Python, C, MATLAB/Octave, and Mathematica
    but have also worked with Java, JavaScript, R, C++, C#, and Eiffel.

    I work on Linux systems most of my time but am comfortable switching
    to other platforms for development when necessary.

    I use git and GitHub / BitBucket for most of my work and have experience
    collaborating in a team through these systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have succeeded in computer science courses on object-oriented
    programming, data structures, algorithms, and software architecture.
    I therefore feel comfortable switching programming languages while
    retaining a deeper understanding of important computational concepts.
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Numerical Analysis</strong></li>
  <p>
    I have received formal training in numerical analysis, enjoy
    refreshing my knowledge of numerical methods, and blog about these
    methods when I can at
    <a href="http://georg.io/na">http://georg.io/na</a>.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong></li>
  <p>
    I am comfortable with basic data structures and algorithms.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning and Statistics</strong></li>
  <p>
    I have received formal training in computational statistics and
    probability theory.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Natural Language Processing and Text Mining</strong></li>
  <p>
    Driven by personal interest in these areas, I apply regularly
    techniques from these fields to scientific publications and blog
    about my discoveries at
    <a href="http://georg.io/nlp">http://georg.io/nlp</a>.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Web Development</strong></li>
  <p>
    Excited by the response to one of my blog posts on
    summarizing PLOS Biology articles
    I have developed a web application
    that does just that: <a href="http://tldrmed.com/">TLDRMed.com</a>.
  </p>
  <li><strong>High Performance Computing</strong></li>
  <p>
    I have great interest in low-level code optimization and parallel computing.
    I completed recently an online course titled "Applications of Parallel Computers" (facilitated by XSEDE) that covered a range of topics such as single machine optimization (cache optimization and vectorization), shared-memory parallelism, and distributed-memory parallelism.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Communication and Technical Writing</strong></h3>
  <p>
    I enjoy writing about technical topics and discoveries on my personal
    blog at <a href="http://georg.io">http://georg.io</a> and am comfortable
    presenting my work both formally and informally.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am the corresponding author on a peer-reviewed article
    that describes our scientific Python package and am the first author on
    our peer-reviewed article
    that investigates stochastic effects in cell polarization.
  </p>
</ul>

<h3>Professional Experience</h3>

<h4><u>PhD Researcher (2010 - present)</u></h4>
<p>John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom</p>
<p>Research in computational biology: Cell-Cell Signalling and Tissue Polarity in Plant Morphogenesis.</p>
<p>I implemented a graph-theoretic framework that facilitates bifurcation analysis of large reaction networks. I solved a range of combinatorial problems by rephrasing them as graph problems and solving them with classical graph algorithms. Enumeration of all cliques of a graph was not available through NetworkX and I implemented an algorithm based on a published article.</p>
<p>I also implemented variants of Crank-Nicolson to integrate numerically a convection-diffusion-reaction system. I used timing techniques, NumPy, and inline C to identify bottlenecks in my implementation and to optimize my code for speed.</p>

<h4><u>Visiting Scholar (2009 - 2010)</u></h4>
<p>The University of British Columbia, 1984 Mathematics Road, V6T 1Z2 Vancouver, Canada</p>
<p>Research and write up of Master thesis: Stochastic Simulations of Cell Polarization and Wave Pinning.</p>
<p>For this project I implemented Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm to simulate a reaction-diffusion system on a one-dimensional domain.
  Since my initial MATLAB implementation was too slow I rewrote time critical code in C.</p>

<h4><u>Teaching Assistant (2008 - 2009)</u></h4>
<p>ETH Zurich Kreuzplatz 5, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland</p>
<p>Research and preparation of lecture notes, preparation of exercise questions, preparation of exam questions, grading exams.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Education</h3>

<h4><u>Master of Science ETH Zurich (2010)</u></h4>
<p>Self-designed major in computational biology and biological chemistry.</p>
<p>Specific mathematical and computational courses that were part of my curriculum:</p>
<p>Bioinformatics in-depth & Computational Systems Biology,
  Numerical Mathematics for CSE,
  Software Architecture,
  Probability and Statistics,
  Data Structures & Algorithms,
  Compiler Design I, and
  Computational Statistics.
</p>

<h4><u>Bachelor of Science ETH Zurich (2008)</u></h4>
<p>Major in biochemistry.</p>
